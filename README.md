# WeatherCalc
C# Console application that calculates day of the month with the maximum spread.
Running the application is very easy and straight to the point, one can use Visual Studio to build and run it. Just change the following const string fileName = "F:\\weather.dat"; to reflect the location of your 'weather.dat' file locally. (That code line is found in the class Program.cs)
